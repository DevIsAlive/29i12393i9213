# Key Components Backup

This document lists the key component files in the project as of the latest checkpoint:

1. `components/Navbar.js` - Main navigation bar with micro-interactions
2. `components/Hero.js` - Hero section with dynamic animations
3. `components/Features.js` - Features section with interactive cards and category filtering
4. `components/Pricing.js` - Pricing section with subtle 3D effects and card animations
5. `components/ShareModal.js` - Modal for sharing functionality
6. `styles/globals.css` - Global CSS styles with animations and effects

Each component has been enhanced with micro-interactions, subtle animations, and responsive design.

## Important CSS Classes

- `.transparent-text` - Special effect for the transparent text in pricing heading
- `.glass-card` - Glass morphism effect for cards
- `.ultra-subtle-tilt` - Very subtle 3D tilt effect
- `.section-fade-top`, `.section-fade-bottom` - Transition effects between sections
- `.gradient-text` - Text with gradient color effect
- `.shine-effect` - Shine animation for buttons and cards

The current implementation focuses on subtle animations and seamless transitions between sections.
